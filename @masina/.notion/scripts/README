This directory contains a collection of user-contributed scripts for Notion.

Installing and using a script
-----------------------------

To use a script put them into your ~/.notion or your global notion directory and 
make sure you load the script with

dopath("scriptname")

in your cfg_notion.lua.


Statusbar scripts
-----------------

Add the monitor(s) provided by the script into the template in cfg_statusbar.lua. Omit any "statusd_" prefixes of the monitor names.

Styles
------

After adding them to your notion directory, do F12->styles/refresh-list. After that the new
styles will be available in your F12 menu.
